# Design and Analysis of Algorithm

This repository contains solutions to the homework assignments given in my college for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithm** course. All codes are written in **C** and focus on implementing and analyzing various algorithms.

## Repository Structure
- Each assignment is organized in separate files for easy reference.
- Problem statements are not included; only solutions are provided.

## Topics Covered
- Divide and Conquer  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Graph Algorithms  
- Backtracking  
- Other fundamental and advanced topics in algorithm design  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithm.git
2. Navigate to the relevant file to view the solution.

3. Compile the C code using:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
